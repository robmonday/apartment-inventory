# Apartment Inventory 2016

## Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Project

This project was part of the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree using Python, which I was completing in 2016. It is designed to showcase a basic ability to pull together Python libraries for web development, including a database and OAuth 2.0. Dependencies include: flask, requests, sqlalchemy, oauth2client.

The use case is for a fictional apartment complex leasing office that is offering apartments to rent for the general public. Unauthenticated users can see apartment availability. Additionally the "leasing office manager" can log into the website to make changes to the apartment units including basic information and unit availability.

## Basic Install Instructions

1. Run database_setup.py to create a sqlite database on the server.
1. Run populate_data.py to add some initial seed data to the database (if you do not wish to create it manually).
1. Run server.py to start the web app on the dev server (port 5000), and [click here](http://127.0.0.1:5000)!
